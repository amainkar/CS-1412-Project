# Dice-Rolling-Game

Write a program in C that makes a dice rolling game where users, user score, user balance are all stored in a file. Everytime a user wants to play, his/her balance must be used to 
toss 2 dies. Depending on the sum of the value of the dies, the score changes. The user can add more balance to their balance and play as long as he has enought balance. If the
user runs out ofmoney it is game over. At the end of the game rewrite all the data to the same file with updated values.
